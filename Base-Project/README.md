# Base-Project

This is a base project for Prime Academy that will be added to throughout the course (until course final day: 10th June 2016).

There are three main components of this project.

1) HTML: This will serve as the base functionality for an html page.
2) JS: This will serve as the functionality of the site itself.
3) CSS: This will serve as the design of the site.
